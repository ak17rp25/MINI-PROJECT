# MINI-PROJECT
This project is basically about the vizualization of live stock price data of different companies and it's comparison using DASH framework, 
Dash apps are basically composed of two parts. 
1.The first part basically contains the  "layout" part  of the app and it basically shows what the application looks like. 
2.The second part basically describes the interactivity of the application.
Dash generally provides Python classes for all of the visual components of the application. 
A set of components in the dash_core_components and the dash_html_components library.
